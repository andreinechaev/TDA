# Temporal Decaying Accumulator (TDA)

## General

The Temporal Decaying Accumulator (TDA) is a custom layer designed to handle time-dependent data by emphasizing the importance of recent information while diminishing the influence of older data. This layer can be particularly useful when dealing with time series data or sequences in which the relevance of past data decreases with time.

Forward pass of the TDA layer:

1. Compute the weights for each time step using the exponential decay function: weight(t) = scaling_factor * exp(-t / time_window).
2. Apply the computed weights to the input tensor x element-wise.
3. Clip the weighted input tensor values to lie between min and max values (optional).
4. Perform further operations on the weighted input tensor as needed.

## Dependencies

TDA is implemented in Python 3 and Pytorch that requires the following packages:

1. numpy
2. pytorch (2.0.0 and 1.13.1 were tested)

To run examples you will also need:

1. matplotlib
2. torchtext
3. torchdata
4. jupyter

## Usage

### TDA Function

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np

from tda.nn import TDA

class TDANetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, time_window, max_value, scaling_factor):
        super(TDANetwork, self).__init__()
        self.max_value = max_value
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size * time_window, hidden_size)
        self.ac = TDA(time_window, scaling_factor)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(x.shape[0], -1)  # Flatten the input tensor along the time_window dimension
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = x.unsqueeze(-1)  # Add an extra dimension for the time_window
        x = self.ac(x).sum(dim=2)
        x = torch.clamp(x, 0, self.max_value)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x
```

### Hyperparameters

#### Time Window

The `time_window` parameter plays a critical role in determining how the TDA function weighs the influence of input values based on their age. Choosing the right value for time_window can significantly impact the performance of the neural network when dealing with time-series data.
It directly affects the exponential decay function used to compute the age-based weights for each input value.
The time_window parameter affects the results in the following ways:

- Emphasis on recent information: A smaller time_window results in a faster decay of the weights associated with older data points. This causes the model to focus more on recent information and less on historical data, which might be useful when recent data is more relevant to the prediction task.
- Retention of historical information: A larger time_window results in a slower decay of the weights associated with older data points. This causes the model to retain more historical information, which might be useful when the past data points still have a significant influence on the prediction task.
- Sensitivity to noise and outliers: A smaller time_window might make the model more sensitive to noise and outliers in the input data, as it focuses more on recent data points. Conversely, a larger time_window might make the model more robust to noise and outliers, as it averages the influence of data points over a more extended period.

#### Scaling Factor

A higher scaling_factor will result in larger weights for each time step, which in turn will lead to larger weighted input values before applying the chosen operation (either 'sum' or 'mean') and the clipping mechanism. This could potentially increase the influence of each input value on the output of the TDA function.

Conversely, a lower scaling_factor will result in smaller weights for each time step, which will decrease the influence of each input value on the output of the TDA function.

The choice of scaling_factor can impact the performance of the neural network, as it determines the magnitude of the weights applied to the input data. It is essential to experiment with different values of scaling_factor to find the optimal balance between emphasizing recent information and diminishing the influence of older data, depending on the specific problem and dataset being used.

#### Max Value (V_max)

It serves as an upper limit for the weighted input values before applying the chosen operation ('sum' or 'mean'). It is used in the clipping step, which ensures that the weighted input values are limited to a specific range, i.e., between 0 and max_value.

The max_value affects the results in the following ways:

- Regularization: By clipping the weighted input values, it can help prevent large output values from dominating the activation function output. This acts as a form of regularization, making the model more robust to outliers and noise in the input data.
- Non-linearity: Clipping introduces a non-linear behavior into the activation function, which can help the neural network learn complex, non-linear relationships between the input data and the target variable.
- Gradient saturation: Setting a very low max_value might cause gradient saturation during the backpropagation, as the gradient of the clipped values will be zero. Gradient saturation can slow down the training process and result in a poorly trained model. On the other hand, if the max_value is too high, the clipping mechanism might not have a significant effect on the output values, and the benefits of regularization and non-linearity may be reduced.

## Advantages and Challenges

**Advantages**:

- **Emphasizing recent information**: The TDA layer can help models better capture the importance of recent data points in time-dependent tasks, potentially improving performance in tasks where the relevance of data decreases over time.
- **Flexibility**: The TDA layer can be easily combined with other types of layers, such as convolutional, recurrent, or fully connected layers, making it a versatile addition to various neural network architectures.
- **Customizability**: The time window and scaling factor parameters can be adjusted to suit the specific needs of a problem, allowing users to control the degree to which older data is discounted.
- **Reduced risk of overfitting**: By diminishing the influence of older data, the TDA layer may help prevent models from overfitting to less relevant information in the input data

**Challenges**:

- **Increased complexity**: The TDA layer adds an extra layer of complexity to the neural network, which may increase the computation time and memory requirements during training and inference.
- **Parameter tuning**: Choosing appropriate values for the time window and scaling factor can be challenging, as the optimal values may depend on the specific task and dataset. This may require experimentation and fine-tuning.
- **Limited applicability**: The TDA layer is specifically designed for time-dependent data and may not be suitable for all types of problems or datasets. In some cases, other types of layers or techniques (e.g., attention mechanisms) might be more effective.

## Further work

1. Adaptive time constant: Instead of using a fixed time constant Ï„, implementing an adaptive time constant that adjusts during training might lead to better performance. This way, the model can learn the appropriate decay rate for the problem at hand, making it more flexible and better suited to various tasks.
2. Content-based weighting: Integrating content-based weighting alongside the temporal weighting could lead to a more robust function. This would allow the model to not only consider the age of the input but also the relevance of the input content, leading to more informed decisions about which information to prioritize.
3. Learnable clipping threshold: Instead of using a fixed maximum value V_max for the clipping mechanism, making the clipping threshold learnable could allow the model to adapt the threshold based on the specific problem and dataset. This could lead to better performance by preventing the loss of important information due to a suboptimal fixed threshold.
4. Dynamic time window: TDA currently uses a fixed time window size N. Allowing the model to learn a dynamic time window size based on the input data could improve its ability to focus on relevant information over different time scales.
5. Multi-scale TDA: Combining multiple TDAs with different time constants and time windows can capture information at various temporal scales. This would enable the model to better understand both short-term and long-term patterns in the data.
6. Incorporating gating mechanisms: Adding gating mechanisms, similar to those used in LSTMs and GRUs, can help control the flow of information within the network. This could allow the model to learn when to store or discard information, potentially leading to better overall performance.
7. Hybrid approach: Combining TDA with other activation functions or attention mechanisms could lead to an improved understanding of the data. A hybrid approach might leverage the strengths of different techniques while mitigating their respective weaknesses.
